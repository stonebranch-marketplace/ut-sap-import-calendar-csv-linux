Overview
This Universal Task allows you to import the SAP Factory Calendar and the related Holiday Calendar into the Universal Controller.

You can either import a user-defined list of SAP calendar using a csv file or all valid SAP calendar. The Calendar Import can be scheduled to be always in sync with SAP; for example, import all Calendar every day. It is also possible to import Calendars from different SAP System.
